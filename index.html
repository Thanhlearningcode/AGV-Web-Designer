<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<div id="project-summary">
    <p>
        Autonomous robots have become a familiar presence in our daily lives, 
        appearing everywhere from rural areas to urban environments, in factories 
        and households, and playing a significant role in both industrial production 
        and everyday activities. These robots greatly assist in replacing humans 
        for difficult and labor-intensive tasks, thereby saving time, resources, 
        and human effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inspired by their wide-ranging applications and practical benefits, this 
        project focuses on developing an autonomous robot capable of performing 
        tasks fully autonomously or semi-autonomously. The project involves several 
        key components:
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly, the design of robust hardware to support the robot's movement 
        and positioning capabilities in a given space. Secondly, developing the 
        robot's ability to create maps and accurately locate itself within those 
        mapped environments. Following this, we implement a path-planning method 
        for the robot to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles. Finally, we 
        integrate a range of applications, such as allowing the robot to move 
        efficiently within dynamic settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The results of this project are promising. The robot successfully maps an 
        unknown environment with minimal deviation and demonstrates a reliable 
        self-localization capability, efficiently navigating to its target with 
        minimal errors. Throughout this development process, I was guided and 
        supported by Dr. Pham Anh Duc, whose expertise was invaluable in achieving 
        these outcomes.
