            Autonomous robots have become a familiar presence in our daily lives, 
            appearing everywhere from rural areas to urban environments, in factories 
            and households. These robots play a significant role in both industrial 
            production and everyday activities, greatly assisting in replacing humans 
            for difficult and labor-intensive tasks, thereby saving time, resources, 
            and human effort.

            Inspired by their wide-ranging applications and practical benefits, this 
            project focuses on developing an autonomous robot capable of performing 
            tasks fully autonomously or semi-autonomously. Key components of the project 
            include designing robust hardware, developing mapping and localization capabilities, 
            implementing path-planning algorithms, and integrating applications for efficient 
            navigation in dynamic settings.

            The results of this project are promising. The robot successfully maps unknown 
            environments with minimal deviation and demonstrates reliable self-localization 
            capabilities, effectively navigating to its targets with minimal errors.
