    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <div id="project-summary">
        <p>
            Autonomous robots have become a familiar presence in our daily lives, 
            appearing everywhere from rural areas to urban environments, in factories 
            and households, and playing a significant role in both industrial production 
            and everyday activities. These robots greatly assist in replacing humans 
            for difficult and labor-intensive tasks, thereby saving time, resources, 
            and human effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by their wide-ranging applications and practical benefits, this 
            project focuses on developing an autonomous robot capable of performing 
            tasks fully autonomously or semi-autonomously. The project involves several 
            key components:
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, the design of robust hardware to support the robot's movement 
            and positioning capabilities in a given space. Secondly, developing the 
            robot's ability to create maps and accurately locate itself within those 
            mapped environments. Following this, we implement a path-planning method 
            for the robot to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles. Finally, we 
            integrate a range of applications, such as allowing the robot to move 
            efficiently within dynamic settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The results of this project are promising. The robot successfully maps an 
            unknown environment with minimal deviation and demonstrates a reliable 
            self-localization capability, efficiently navigating to its target with 
            minimal errors. Throughout this development process, I was guided and 
            supported by Dr. Pham Anh Duc, whose expertise was invaluable in achieving 
            these outcomes.
